<p>X)I have read several articles on the OWASP 10 2021 website:</p>
<p>1. A03:2021 – Injection.</p>
<p>This article discusses various modern options for introducing malware into code. It also provides examples of preventing it from interacting with any files, as well as attack scenarios in addition. To be honest, not all of the implementation scenarios given in the article were clear to me; in the material I read, there is a separate terminology that I had to look at the wiki to understand :)</p>
<p>2. A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration and A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components.</p>
<p>Here in these articles you can find out the entire need for correct and updated application configuration, as well as the importance of using supported components. The fact is that there are cases of vulnerability as a result of incorrect configuration of the security functions of the application, or incorrect operation due to the incompatibility of updated library components, or the most banal and I think everyone knows outdated software. The best options and methods that should be followed are also described here:</p>
<p>-Using a minimized platform without unnecessary functions, protocols, documentation, dependencies and components</p>
<p>-Automation of most processes (checking settings, updates and configuration security effectiveness)</p>
<p>-Use components only from official sources via secure links.</p>
<p>All articles contain a lot of useful information, ranging from problem areas and vulnerabilities, ending with useful tips and statistics, I can confidently say that I liked reading this :)/p>
